# project_2

This is a full-stack application that connects users who are looking for side jobs, and those that have side jobs that need to be performed. The front-end was built using the CSS library Foundation, with data rendering done by Handlebars.js. The back-end of the website utilizes a mySQL database, and servers built with node.js and Express.
